This project is utilising a FIFO organisation system to distribute computational marking of multiple ML models in order to distribute the compute load required for completion. 
This library also offer a wide variety of sanitization types, by the specific file type (we expect all saved models to be .mdf5) but also the actual type of saved model, (e.g: logistic regression, NN, Transformer.. etc)
All parsed models are expected to be produced via torch.save(model) as this downloads the entire model class, not just saved hyperparameters etc. If you are looking for a solution for torch.save(model.state_dict()) then we suggest to look for another library of fork this library.
