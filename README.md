This project is utilising a FIFO organisation system to distribute computational marking of multiple ML models in order to distribute the compute load required for completion. 
This library also offer a wide variety of sanitization types, by the specific file type (we expect all saved models to be .mdf5) but also the actual type of saved model, (e.g: logistic regression, NN, Transformer.. etc)
